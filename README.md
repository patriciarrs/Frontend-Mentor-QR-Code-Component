## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since this is a simple component, I kept this solution as simple as possible.

I add to search how to add Google fonts and a style sheet.

I also learned how to use Figma to find out the font size, the spacing between elements and the shadow values for the component.

### Useful resources

- [Box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing#try_it) - It is often useful to set box-sizing to border-box to lay out elements. This makes dealing with the sizes of elements much easier, and generally eliminates a number of pitfalls. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
